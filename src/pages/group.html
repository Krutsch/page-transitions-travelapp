    Arrival: We settled in and decided to go snorkeling. We saw spotted
    dolphins, tons of whales - one whale went right under the boat, and, of
    course, plenty of sea turtles. The snorkeling area is a little small and can
    get crowded, but we still had great opportunities to watch the turtles. The
    crew was terrific - Jason, Jackson, and Shane. We would definitely recommend
    this activity, and will do it again if we ever get back to Hawaii!

    After such an exciting first day, we decided to take it a bit easier and
    just get a nice lunch as our day activity. Had a wonderful time getting an
    opportunity to walk around a few blocks of Ala Moana and sampling some of
    the local eats that you can't really get back home. Every stop had something
    new and interesting to try, and there wasn't a single thing I tried that I
    really disliked.
